# Video Archiver

A easy way to watch your favorite videos with no internet.

Should only require a program that can run PHP scripts.
## Installation

To use it you will need:

- FFmpeg in path | Download : [gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)
or

Windows : 
``` 
winget install "FFmpeg (Essentials Build)"
```

Uses [YT-DLP](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for the downloader.
* You could update it just place the exe in the same place as the old one.
